Personal notes on dye sublimation processes

Things to get:

- A compatible object to dyesub on
- Dye sublimation paper
- A dye sublimation compatible printer
- A dye sublimation compatible cartridge, usually a CISS kit
- Dye sublimation ink
- Proper software to print with advanced color profiles support and custom ICC profiles

## Dye sublimation paper

Dyesub paper has a specific side coated with chemicals, which is the face that needs to be printed on.

- Print on the whiter side of the dye sublimation paper (less grain, smoother)
- When loading in the printer tray, double check which side the printer will print on

## Dye sublimation ink

Test the ink before putting it in the cartridges.

- If the ink come in bottles, put a droplet from each bottle onto the correct side of dyesub paper, and try to sublimate it onto polyester fabric
  - It might turn out that one of colors will not sublimate properly, especially the black ink
  
## Testing the printer

Before installing any ink, train yourself in using the printer with normal ink in order to get a hang on how color management in Photoshop works (ICC profiles), and how the printer driver works.

Once the dyesub ink is installed, the colors will look completely different on paper and it becomes very difficult to figure out the print quality.

- Always set the paper settings to photo quality in the printer settings
- No matter what ICC setting is set to, and no matter what the paper is, when printing with dyesub ink, colors will appear washed out when printed
  - On dyesub paper, colors become brighter and more vivid after heating (dye turning into gas)

## Fabrics

- Dyesub will not work as well on 100% cotton
- Use at least 50% polyester (not sure about the percentage though)

## Plastics

- Find out the plastic type before trying anything
  - ABS has a very low melting point, lower than the heat necessary for dyesub, never try dyesub on ABS ever
  - PBT might melt around 220 degrees Celsius, check the temperature of the heat press or heating element beforehand

## Maintenance

- Ink from a dyesub printer is subject to these aging effects
  - Drying if the printer is not used often enough
  - Evaporation
  - Waste ink saturation
