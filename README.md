# dyesub-notes

- Dyesub paper: Print on the whiter side (less grain, smoother)
- Colors will appear washed out when printed on both normal and dyesub paper
  - On dyesub paper, colors become brighter and more vivid after heating (dye turning into gas)
- If a color prints, it doesn't mean it will be transferrable. Check the quality of the black ink
- For textiles, we need polyester, don't try on 100% cotton or other purely natural textiles
- For plastics, ABS has a lower melting point than the heat necessary for dyesub, don't even try
